## Overview
x47PropCalc is a **trade size calculator** designed for traders to customize parameters specific to various companies, ensuring accurate trade size calculations. Beyond calculations, it allows users to save trades, log timestamps, and receive notifications when profit or loss targets are met. The app doubles as a **trade journal**, enabling users to add notes post-trade. Future features may include generating downloadable Profit and Loss (PnL) cards and importing trades from an MT5 account with proprietary trading firms.
